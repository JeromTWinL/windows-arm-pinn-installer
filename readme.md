# os contents
These are the os contents to install windows 10

You can issue to use your install.wim WARNING:***It must be windows 10 (windows 11 needs 4gb ram ,raspberry pi 3 has 1gb ram only and only supported for pi3!)***

I don't have a windows 10 wim/iso, so i have used [empyreal96](https://empyreal96.github.io/Win10ARM64.html)'s modified wim to install windows 10 (the wim was tested by me)
